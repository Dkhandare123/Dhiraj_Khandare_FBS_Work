#Variables in Python

In Python, variables are used to store data values. Think of a variable as a name or label that points to a piece of data in memory.

Identifier:
An identifier is the name used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, or other objects in Python.

Rules for Naming Variables:
1. Names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (_)

2. The rest of the name can contain letters, numbers, or underscores

3. Variable names are case-sensitive (name and Name are different)

4. Avoid using Python keywords like if, while, for, etc.
